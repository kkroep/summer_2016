\subsection{Motivation}\label{ssec:motivation}
UV sensors have numerous applications including oberservation during assembly and the oberservation of outer space. One of the challenges of UV sensors is to deal with sensitivity to visible light, which is the main product of solar irradiation. Gallium Nitride (GaN) has intrinsic solar blindness, which makes it a prime candidate for UV sensors. The material can also still be used in solid state devices. There is currently no alternative to this combination of solarblindness and solid state. This research project focusses on the nontrivial task of designing and characterizing a suitable readout circuit for a GaN sensor. The project builds on the work of Padmanabhan et al. ???, who designed a first version of a Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC). The main goal of this project is to characterize the ROIC, evaluate it's performance when coupled with GaN sensors, and propose improvements for future ROICs.
