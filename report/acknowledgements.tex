\section{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:acknowledgements}
In the summer of 2016 I was invited to contribute to research in NASA's Jet Propulsion Labaratory (JPL), which is a dream come true. After I participated in the course Digital IC Design, Dr. Edoardo Charbon provided me with the amazing opportunity to go to JPL and do a research project in the group of Dr Shouleh Nikzad. I would like to thank Dr. Edoardo Charbon and Shouleh Nikzad for giving me this opportunity. I would also like to thank Dr. Douglas Bell, who supported me throughout the project and teached me valuable lessons trough his knowledge and experience. I would like to thank Dr. Bruce Hancock, who shared his experience and thought process in numerous ocasions. He learned me how to analyse the imperfections and side effects that can occur in real devices, and what kind of considerations are made during the design process to address those issues. I would like to thank the entire group, Advanced detectors, Systems and Nanoscience, who generously shared their experience in both research and living in LA. They provided a safe and comfortable work environment that made me enjoy my stay without tension or pressure. I hope to collaborate with this group again in the future.
