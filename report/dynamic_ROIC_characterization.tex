\section{Dynamic ROIC characterization}\label{sec:dynamic_ROIC_characterization}
The next step is to look at the dynamic behaviour of the ROIC under varying input currents. The aim of this section is to characterize the dynamic behavior of the three different components of the ROIC seperately: The source followers, integrator and voltage limiter respecively. In order to measure this, a more sophisticated setup is required.


\subsection{Setup}\label{ssec:dynamic_setup}
The desired measurements require a lot of samples and in order to observe a slope, waveforms. Also the device needs to be reset in order to oberserve the dynamic behavior of the integrator. In order to address all those issues, the function generator in the oscilloscope is used to create a periodic pulse for the reset. The trigger function of the oscilloscope is used to observe the period around the rising edge of the reset. The averaging function on the oscilloscope is used to reduce the effect of noise. The input voltage is manually controlled through a voltage source. The observed waveforms are stored to a usb and transported to a computere. On the computer, these waveforms are further processed in \texttt{octave-cli} (octave command line interface), which generates plots that are directly inserted into pdf. A bashscript is used to automate all processes on the computer.

This setup provides a convenient method of processing a lot of data, without an insurmountable amount of manual labor.

\subsection{Calcution of current}
The calculation of the slope can be tackled in many different ways. Throughout the project, multiple calculation methods where used. For all measurements in this setup the same method is used. First on the oscilloscope an averaging of 128 is used. This means that waveforms of 128 reset signals are averaged out. This is done to eliminate noise that is prevalent in this setup. To estimate the slope two points on the middle of the slope are taken, and used to calculate the slope between the two. The calculated slope estimates the steepest part in the waveform.

The voltages on the chosen points in the waveform are first altered to compensate for the behavior of the source followers. Finally, to go from slope to current, the slope will be divided by the integration capacitance. 



\subsection{Source followers}\label{ssec:dynamic_source_followers}
The design of the source follower is described in \cref{ssec:source_follower}. In order to characterize the behavior of the source follower, a voltage source is directly connected to the input of the ROIC. This forces the output of the voltage limiter to the same value as the source follower, as long as the voltage limiter is not cut-off. The input of the source follower connected to the VBO output, is directly connected to this output, and is therefore fully controllable. The output of this source follower can be directly be observed. This means that the characteristics of the source follower can be measured directly. Note that the source follower connected to the output of the integrator is identical, which means that only one needs to be characterized. \Cref{fig:source_follower} shows both the measured data and a fitted line with the formula $vbo=0.827v_{in}-0.624$. In order to avoid pile-up it will be assumed that this formula characterizes the performance of both source followers for $1<V_{in}<4\,V$.

\subsection{Integrator}\label{ssec:dynamic_integrator}
The measurements of the behavior of the integrator are devided into three sections. \Cref{sssec:standard_behavior} will focus on the output of the ROIC for low currents. \Cref{sssec:high_current_behavior} will do the same, but this time for currents that are a lot higher. Finally \cref{sssec:VBO_behavior} will look at the behavior of VBO, and investigate the viability of using the input follower as a secondary readout. Note that all plots are not what is directly observed at the output. All results have compensation for the behavior of the source followers.

\subsection{Voltage limiter}\label{ssec:dynamic_voltage_limiter}
In \cref{fig:vbo_slopes} one can already observe the voltage limiter in action. The measurements in \cref{fig:vbo_slopes} are taken with a $V_g=4.5\,V$, but it is worth investigating the bevahior between $V_g$ and the voltage limit posed by the voltage limiter. \Cref{fig:vg_vs_vbo} shows the measurement rsults of relationship between $V_g$ and the voltage limit posed by the high voltage transistor at the input. The relationship appears the be linear between 3 and $3.8\,V$, but changes behavior at higher $V_g$. A possible explanation for this might be found in the reset transistor used to reset the integration capacitance. The body voltage of that pmos transistor is connected to the VDD of the circuit which is $3.3\,V$. Normally, this means that there is no current from source to the body, because the body is at the highest voltage, and the p-n junction between source and body will not conduct. This changes when the source voltage rises above the body voltage however, which can cause the p-n junction to draw current. This issue could explain the changed behavior of the voltage threshold at higher $V_g$. If this is the case, then a high $V_g$ is very undesireable to operate the device, for it means that the device draws current even when saturated.
